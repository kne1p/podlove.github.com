# The Podlove Project

Podlove is an initiative by Metaebene Personal Media to improve the overall technical infrastructure for podcasting. Podlove is both a network for developers to discuss features and agree on standards as well as an incubator for software and file formats under the Podlove name.

The purpose of this site is to provide a central place for guides and documentation for projects under the Podlove name.
